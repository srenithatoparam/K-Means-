# K-Means Clustering Algorithm

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm in Python. The K-Means algorithm is a popular machine learning algorithm used for unsupervised learning tasks, specifically for clustering data into K distinct groups based on their similarity.

The goal of the K-Means algorithm is to partition the dataset into K clusters where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid).

## Features
- Implementation of the K-Means algorithm from scratch.
- Support for visualizing clusters in 2D space (for 2D datasets).
- Flexible number of clusters (`K`) as an input parameter.
- Easy-to-understand code and step-by-step explanation.

## Requirements
Before running the code, ensure that you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas` (optional, for dataset handling)

You can install the required libraries using pip: 

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
